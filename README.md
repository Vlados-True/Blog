# Blog

I created models, views, and URLs to implement a blog in my Django application. To make it easy to manage the blog, I also implemented an admin site. Additionally, I created sitemaps and RSS feeds to improve search engine optimization and make it easier for readers to follow the blog.

To make it easy to create and publish new posts, I implemented a posting system that allows authors to create, edit, and publish new posts. I also added support for tags, allowing readers to easily find posts on similar topics.

To enhance the reading experience, I added features such as Markdown editing support, which allows authors to format posts using Markdown syntax. I also implemented a related posts feature that recommends other posts to readers based on the content of the current post.

Lastly, I implemented full-text search using PostgreSQL, allowing readers to easily search for posts based on keywords or phrases. These features combine to create a robust and user-friendly blogging platform within my Django application.
